As to show how much we’re proud of the contributions women in technology make across the industry, WTM Algiers like all WTM communities across the globe, as a part of the Women Techmakers program, celebrates this day every year.
The aim of this edition was to give a new vision on today’s technologies and evolve the algerian concepts and habits of the lean consumption in terms of technologies.Through series of inspiring conferences/talks and interesting workshops alongside a design thinking hackathon,  we could host more than 60% of women attendee."
